# Free Font Files

This project contains binary font files served by the following sites:

* https://www.google.com/fonts
* https://www.fontsquirrel.com/
* http://www.dafont.com/

Subdirectories are named according to the family name of the fonts within. Each font directory contains the font binary, font preview images, and font subset only containing the glyphs of the font's name, and a file containing information about the font.

Licensing
---------

It is important to always read the license for every font that you use. Each font family directory contains a info.json file which hold information about the font's license. All fonts from google or fontsquirrel are free for both personal and commercial use.

Most of the fonts in the collection use the SIL Open Font License, v1.1, or the Apache 2 license.

The SIL Open Font License has an option for copyright holders to include a Reserved Font Name requirement, and this option is used with some of the fonts. If you modify those fonts, please take care of this important detail.
