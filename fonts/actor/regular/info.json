  "description": "A diploma thesis project from the Aachen University of Applied Sciences at Karl-Friedrich (Kai) Oetzbach. The font originated in a course in type design. The idea was to learn through the creation of a typeface about writing as an information carrier. It was created entirely digitally, so the path to the current version is very rocky and winding. Actor has a strong x-height, which is why it always requires a fairly high line spacing. The digits of Actor are created as old style figures. The forms of 6 and 9 are more dynamic and more tense than usual. The 8 has significantly shifted interiors and the 7 is slightly curved to the left.",
