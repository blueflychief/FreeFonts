  "description": "Alike Angular is a complementary titling style to Alike Regular. It shares the same proportions as its counterpart for compatibility, and is designed for larger display sizes. As opposed to the soft Regular its letterforms consist of only straight splines and additional expressive features are introduced in characters like T, Z, M, E. Designed by Sveta Sebyakina, Alexei Vanyashin from 2009 and first released in 2011 by Cyreal.",
