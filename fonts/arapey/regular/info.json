  "description": "Arapey (Ah-ra-pay) is a contemporary modern typeface. The first sketches of this typography were made during a vacation in Arapey, a small town the north of Uruguay, hence its name. While this font style has reminiscences of a Bodoni, the structures, soft lines and finishes give the words that use it a calm and distinguished feeling. The italics are gentle, rhythmic, and bring a special glamour to both text use and titles.",
