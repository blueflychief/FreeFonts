  "description": "Archivo Narrow was designed to be used simultaneously in print and digital platforms. The technical and aesthetic characteristics of the font are both crafted for high performance typography. Archivo is a grotesque sans serif typeface family from Omnibus-Type. It was originally designed for highlights and headlines. This family is reminiscent of late nineteenth century American typefaces. It includes Narrow and Black styles, and was derived from Chivo. Updated December 10th 2012 to fix encoding tables and index (Thanks Theunis de Jong for his technical input.) To contribute to the project contact Omnibus-Type.",
