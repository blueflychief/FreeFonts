  "description": "Bonbon is a fancy handwriting font for cheerful and bright headlines. The letterforms are artistic and naive as if they are written in a teenage girl\u0027s diary. It is drawn with a fine marker by author Ksenia Erulevich. Curves are carefully adjusted so that the font will also work well in print - making it a good choice for appetizing product design, greeting cards, or titling in children\u0027s books. Extra ornamental characters are included.",
