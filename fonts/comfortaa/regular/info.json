If you like it please visit my DeviantArt page and fav it (but obviously only if you like it.) You are also more than welcome to comment about anything you want (I\u0027m open to critique). I obviously would love to see how my font is being used, so feel free to comment with a link to your work, or send me a message. I hope you will enjoy using my font!",
