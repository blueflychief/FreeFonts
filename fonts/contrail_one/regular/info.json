  "description": "Contrail is based on handmade sans letters seen on UK posters. It\u0027s slight slant and bouncy quality suggest the emerging jet age and a state of both readiness and excited anticipation. Its rounded corners give it an approachable friendly feeling. Contrail is a low contrast design that is suitable for use in medium to large sizes including headlines. This font was made specifically to be used as web type.",
