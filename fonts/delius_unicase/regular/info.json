  "description": "Delius Unicase is part of a high quality comic book lettering typeface super-family. It has mixed uppercase and lowercase letters for \u0027unicase\u0027 uses, such as in comic strip lettering. It has companion families, Delius and Delius Swash Caps. A round marker was used to define Delius\u0027s stroke: the line gets thicker at both ends to define the beginning and end of the stroke, as a marker line would do, and the ductus imitates the movements of handwriting.",
