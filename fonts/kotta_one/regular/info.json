  "description": "Kotta One is a new and unusual text typeface that mixes the characteristics of an italic with legibility of a roman. Kotta uses a true calligraphic construction, with a structure based on a real italic hand, not simple mechanical slanted forms. Like Renaissance typefaces it is an independent style, not merely an accompaniment for a roman. Kotta One is also a modern style, angular and geometric, exploring the ideas of American typographer Williams Addison Dwiggins and his M-Formula. Sharp lines and strong horizontal strokes give it a rhythm that reads well in long texts.",
