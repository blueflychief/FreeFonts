  "description": "Magra is a sans serif typeface designed for contexts in which both spatial economy and multiple composition styles are required. Its neutral personality and humanist features makes it a perfect candidate for corporate uses too. Its large x-height and robust stems provide good legibility and economy, plus great behavior in smaller sizes. Magra was selected to be part of the German editorial project Typodarium 2012.",
