  "description": "Play is a minimalistic sans serif typeface designed by Jonas Hecksher during his time as Type Director of Playtype Type Foundry. All letters in Play derive from the \u0027O\u0027 â€“ square and circular at the same time. Play is designed with large, open counters, ample lowercase x-heights and a corporate, yet friendly appearance. The combination of these qualities give Play both a high legibility and readability. Updated: February 2016 to version 1.003, removing faulty kern table and updating name table metadata, and applying ttfautohint hinting for Windows Firefox.",
