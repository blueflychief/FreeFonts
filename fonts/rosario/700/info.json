  "description": "Omnibus Type proudly presents Rosario, a new typeface of classic proportions, subtle contrast and weak endings. Carefully produced, elegant, ideal for magazines and academic journals. Rosario is the name of the city of the designer, HÃ©ctor Gatti. Rosario was initially developed for private use in 2003. An Italic was added on 7th September 2011. An Bold and Bold Italic were added on 6th December 2011. All styles were updated with improved hinting and other technical optimizations by Adobe TypeKit in May 2013. Updated: January 2016 with a technical fix to the Bold Italic.",
