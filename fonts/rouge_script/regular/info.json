  "description": "Rouge Script is a formal script type, initiall drawn by hand with a copperplate nib and redrawn with the termination style of a brush script. This gives it the flavor of a casual script. It is very soft and has fast curves, while its low slant angle makes it very legible and improves the render on-screen. It works perfectly for titles or short phrases in branding, magazines, food, feminine and fashion related typography.",
