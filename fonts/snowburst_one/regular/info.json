  "description": "Snowburst One is a low contrast serifed display typeface inspired by one of Annet Stirling\u0027s distinctive styles of lettering. Snowburst One\u0027s personality consistently shows in both small and large sizes. Because of the thin stokes this font is best used from medium to large sizes. Despite its surprising forms Snowburst is highly legible. Readers are likely to be both surprised and entertained by its unusual but friendly forms.",
