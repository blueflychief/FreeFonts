  "description": "In geometry, a spirax is a curved line starting from a central point and moving progressively away and around that point. The Spirax font is inspired in this concept, trying to make you feel that you can go away from your starting point but you’ll never be foreign. Spirax has a pronounced contrast and original curves. It can be used for headlines and shorter texts. Spirax is cute at all sizes! Designed by Brenda Gallo and Gustavo Dipre.",
