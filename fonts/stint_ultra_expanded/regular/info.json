  "description": "Stint Ultra Expanded is an ultra expanded square serif typestyle developed based on the letterforms of the Syncopate Family. Syncopate boasts extra wide unicase forms, and Stint Ultra Expanded follows this direction, featuring wide letterforms of both the capital and lowercase varieties. This is the opposite of the Stint Ultra Condensed typestyle. Highly legible and matching the Syncopate family width, Stint Ultra Expanded is a perfect font for powerful headlines and copy when realty on websites and designs is less of a concern. To contribute to the project contact Brian J. Bonislawsky at astigma@astigmatic.com",
