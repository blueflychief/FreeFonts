  "description": "unkempt /ˌənˈkem(p)t/ adj. 1. lacking in order, neatness, and often cleanliness. Font designer Squid may be a bit disorderly but that didn\u0027t keep him from hand-lettering this off-kilter gem just for you. Unkempt is definitely different than your traditional regimented font but, it\u0027s hardly dirty! In fact, you can download it in a nifty little package that\u0027s never been touched by human hands. And it\u0027s fun! Get it!",
