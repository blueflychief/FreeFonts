  "description": "A serif display type that is very feminine. I think that this is the only type in the world with such a feminine essence. Yeseva\u0027s name is from the phrase \"Yes, Eva.\" As a sign of complete agreement between a man and a woman. I dedicate this font to my beloved wife. Yeseva\u0027s design was updated in September 2012, and version 2.0 is 5 percent narrower. I added a lot of new characters and refined many of the existing ones. Updated: January 2016 with a technical fix to the non-breaking-space character.",
