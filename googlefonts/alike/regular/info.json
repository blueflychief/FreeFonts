  "description": "Alike is a text typeface with expressive and tense letterforms. Its design features are said to have Czech influence, but are softened for a friendlier feel. The proportions are regular and the contrast is low for a pleasant reading experience. It was initially designed by Sveta Sebyakina 2009-2011. To contribute to the project, visit github.com/cyrealtype/Alike Updated: January 2016 to Version 1.212, to correct GPOS table (enabling kerning, so the horizontal metrics may change, causing some reflow in Firefox where kerning is used by default.)",
