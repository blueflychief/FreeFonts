  "description": "Anton is a reworking of a traditional advertising sans serif typeface. The letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont, the counters have been opened up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold display font in modern web browsers. Update: Anton was extended from a single bold style into a family in March 2013, named Antonio.",
