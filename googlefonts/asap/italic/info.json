  "description": "Asap is a contemporary sans-serif family with subtle rounded corners. Designed by Pablo Cosgaya, Asap (\"as soon as possible\") there are 4 styles: Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic. This family, specially developed for screen and desktop use, offers a standarised character width on all styles, which means lines of text remain the same length. This useful feature allows users to change type styles on-the-go without reflowing a text body. Asap is based on Ancha (designed by Pablo Cosgaya and Hector Gatti), and has been developed with the collaboration of Andrés Torresi.",
