  "description": "Bad Script started from a simple six-letter logotype and developed into a separate font, supporting Latin and Cyrillic character sets. It was completely made using a tablet to imitate casual and neat handwriting. Designed to resemble the designer\u0027s own handwriting, while making it systematic and smooth. Designed by Roman Shchyukin from Gaslight.",
