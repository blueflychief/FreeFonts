  "description": "Baumans is a geometric typeface for headlines. Its letterforms are inspired by Bauhaus typefaces and preconstructivist forms. The concept of the typeface fits with Moholy-Nagy\u0027s typography statement that type must be clear, legible, and communicate its message. The main distinctive features are the sharp corners in MVW, curved Z and unicase-like N. Contrast is monolinear and proportions are balanced. Baumans is suitable for medium to large sizes and optimized for screen. Designed by Henadij Zarechnjuk.",
