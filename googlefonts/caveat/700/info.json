  "description": "Caveat is a handwriting type family designed by Pablo Impallari. It is designed for both short annotations and body text usage. For a different style, there is also a sister family, Caveat Brush The fonts have OpenType features that enable the letters to have slight variations according to their occurrence within a word, for a natural handwritten feel.",
