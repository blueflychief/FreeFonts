  "description": "Delius is a high quality comic book lettering typeface super-family; it has several families, Delis, Delius Unicase and Delius Swash Caps. A round marker was used to define Delius\u0027s stroke: the line gets thicker at both ends to define the beginning and end of the stroke, as a marker line would do, and the ductus imitates the movements of handwriting.",
