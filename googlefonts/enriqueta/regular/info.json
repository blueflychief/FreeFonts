  "description": "Enriqueta is a serif typeface designed to meet the technical demands of silkscreen printing. Since that is a grid system, this makes it an excellent candidate for digital display applications too since they are built in pixels. Its a slab serif type with clear, direct and not so subtle features, that was conceived as a hybrid that takes from the Egyptian style some robustness and strong serifs, and from Roman fonts the proportions and soft humanist tones, resulting in a harmonic and legible typeface for texts. Enriqueta was selected to be exhibit at Tipos Latinos 2010, fourth Latin-american tipography biennial and to be part of the German editorial project Typodarium 2012.",
