  "description": "Exo is a contemporary geometric sans serif typeface that tries to convey a technological/futuristic feeling while keeping an elegant design. Exo was meant to be a very versatile font, so it has 9 weights (the maximum on the web) each with a true italic version. It works great as a display face but it also works good for small to intermediate size texts. Update December 2013: Exo was completely redrawn and published as Exo 2, with a more organic look that will perform much better at small text sizes and in long texts.",
