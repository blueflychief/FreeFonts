  "description": "Expletus Sans is a display typeface, which means that it is not recommended for long pieces of text. However, it\u0027s very effective for setting headers and other large sized text, due to it\u0027s way of pulling in the reader. It comes in 4 weights and will include italics from May 2011. It\u0027s character set supports most European languages, but if you do wish to have several extra glyphs made to support your language, please don\u0027t hesitate to send an email to jasper@designtown.nl",
