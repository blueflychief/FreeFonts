  "description": "Based on Fairfield, the typeface first published in 1940 and designed by Rudolph Ruzicka, a famous Czech-American type designer. Fanwood Text roman and italic are the same as Fanwood, but slightly darker and reduced in contrast; this was tailored for increased readability on the Amazon Kindle 3 e-book reader hardware. For more information about the typeface, read the Wikipedia article on Fairfield. The fonts are available from the designer\u0027s own site, Sortmill, with a very liberal MIT-style license, and are made available here and on the League of Movable Type under the SIL OFL, without a Reserved Font Name.",
