  "description": "Federo is a display webfont that references Jakob Erbar\u0027s Feder Grotesk. The goal was to keep the typeface as close as possible to the original 1909 design while adapting it for crisp web typography. Details were refined and contrast was slightly reduced for consistency. Figures obtained regular proportions and counters were increased for better legibility. Designed by Olexa Volochay in 2011.",
