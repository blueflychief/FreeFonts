  "description": "Designer: Riccardo De Franceschi Goblin One belongs to the category of display types called \"Latin\". This is because of its sharp triangular serifs. Goblin One was inspired by a hand painted sign above a pub in the town of Reading (UK). Goblin One is a somewhat wide medium contrast design with a large x-height. Goblin One is both attention-getting and fun. Goblin is suitable for use in medium to large sizes including headlines. This font was made specifically to be web type.",
