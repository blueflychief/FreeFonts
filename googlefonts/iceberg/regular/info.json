  "description": "Iceberg is a slim condensed decorative webfont by Victor Kharyk suitable for medium to large sizes. It is monolinear and mostly monospaced, has long ascenders and descenders, and a modular construction that builds a rhythm. These features improve overall readability. Its monolinear strokes and 45 degree cuts echo letters made from folded tape.",
