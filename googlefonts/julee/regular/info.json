  "description": "The peculiarity of this typography lies in its curved structures and strokes, which are developed on it by getting thinner and sharper as if they were being typed using a metallic and bevel-edged point. The visual mark characteristic of Julee is a casual cursive-like type, yet balanced due to the tidy proportions of its signs. More documentation can be found at www.tipo.net.ar",
