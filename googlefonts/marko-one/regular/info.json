  "description": "Marko One is a typeface designed for children\u0027s literature. The initial idea was to create a typeface-companion for Marko the Sparrow - a cartoon character by illustrator and type designer Zhenya Spizhovyi. Marko One is simple and smooth, has special inner tension and eye-catchy detailing. The letterforms are based on calligraphy and sketches - this is what makes Marko lively, enchanting, and amiable. Marko One typeface will work best in medium to large sizes and captivating headlines. It is technically optimized for better performance on screen, while carefully adjusted outlines promise good quality in print too.",
