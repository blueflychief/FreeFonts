  "description": "\u0027Merienda\u0027 is a Spanish term for \"afternoon snack\", and this pleasant time of the day was worth its own typography. Merienda has soft shapes, is slightly condensed, and has a rhythm which is an invitation to read short pieces of text. It is ideal for headlines which call for height, as its strokes resemble those of a brush and deliver freshness and a dynamic touch in the development of words. Merienda One is the initial publication of this typeface family in a single bold style.",
