  "description": "Miniver was inspired by a trip made to the library, looking for new ideas. Immediately gravitating towards the DVD for the 1942 film Mrs. Miniver, the hand-lettered title on the cover had a very contemporary look and feel so, there was the \u0027springboard\u0027 into a new font. First drawn were the inline forms and then they were traced, utilizing a playful \u0027cutout\u0027 effect.",
