  "description": "This font was designed especially for the user interfaces of mobile platforms. The metrics are compatible with the Latin glyphs of Droid Sans and the number of glyphs is less than in other Khmer fonts, so the file size of font is smaller and loads faster on the web. The font has been prepared specially for use on the web. This version of Nokora has the OpenType tables required for Khmer rendering with the Harfbuzz found in Android 3.1+ and Android 4.0. The OpenType tables in this font also work with Uniscribe system in Microsoft Windows the CoreText system found in Apple Mac OS X Lion. Nokora started as the Droid Sans files which were modified by Dahn Hong. It was updated in September 2012.",
