  "description": "Nothing You Could Do is based on the handwriting of a photographer friend. I chose the name because it echoes my love for my husband and children and how my love for them is unconditional and not based on anything they could do or say. I love this handwriting because it is human, it is imperfect, and it is natural. Real humans don’t write perfectly neatly, and this font creates that feeling of authenticity.",
