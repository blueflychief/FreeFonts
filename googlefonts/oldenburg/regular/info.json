  "description": "Oldenburg is inspired by nearly monoline handwritting seen on a series of German posters. It has been changed and adapted to be more broadly useful design than a more faithful interpretation would have been. Despite the increased ulity in Oldernburg it still presenst plenty of the whimsical feeling that made its source so attractive. Oldenburg can be used a in a wide range of sizes.",
