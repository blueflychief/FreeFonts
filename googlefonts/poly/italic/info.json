  "description": "Poly is a medium contrast serif font. With short ascenders and a very high x-height, Poly is efficient in small sizes. Thanks to its careful balance between the x-height and glyph widths, it allows more economy and legibility than standard web serifs, even in small sizes. This font was originally designed to compose texts in agglutinative languages; these contain very long words. The goal was to develop a typeface that would tolerate cramped tracking and that would increase the number of letters on a single line. Poly is a Unicode typeface family that supports Open Type features and languages that use the Latin script and its variants, especially Native South American language families.",
