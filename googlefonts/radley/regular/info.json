  "description": "Radley is based on lettering originally drawn and designed for woodcarved titling work. Radley was later digitised and extended to be used as a webfont. It is a practical face, based on letterforms used by hand carvers, where lettering needs to be cut quickly, efficiently, but with style. Radley grew out of sketching and designing directly into wood with traditional carving chisels, to design the basic letterforms of a new typeface.The finalised characters were then scanned and traced into FontForge before being cleaned up digitally and the character set expanded. There is something unique about carving letters into wood with traditional hand tools, hopefully Radley carries some of the original spirit of these hand carved letterforms. Radley can be used for titling and text. It has been designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.",
