  "description": "Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. A thorough review and italic was added in 2016. It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set. It also has a sister family, Raleway Dots. More information can be found at theleagueofmoveabletype.com and impallari.com To contribute to the project, visit github.com/impallari/Raleway Updated: Feburary 2016, thoroughly updated the design with new spacing and kerning, raised f bar, added italics, new family naming metadata, and hinted with ttfautohint.",
