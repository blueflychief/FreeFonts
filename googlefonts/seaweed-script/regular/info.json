  "description": "Hear that? That\u0027s the sound of tropical ocean breezes as they whistle gently through your laptop! Grab a mai-tai, a hammock under a swaying palm tree and let your hair down as your fingers gently caress the keyboard just like seaweed! Enjoy Seaweed Script when a rustic tropical beachside script is called for and watch out for Squid! Designed by Dave \u0027Squid\u0027 Cohen of Neapolitan (a DBA of Font Diner, Inc.) To contribute to the project, contact the Font Diner.",
