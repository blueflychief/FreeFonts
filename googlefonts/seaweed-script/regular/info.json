  "description": "Hear that? That\u0027s the sound of tropical ocean breezes as they whistle gently through your laptop! Grab a mai-tai, a hammock under a swaying palm tree and let your hair down as your fingers gently caress the keyboard just like seaweed! Enjoy Seaweed Script when a rustic tropical beachside script is called for and watch out for Squid! Designed by Dave \u0027Squid\u0027 Cohen of Neapolitan (a DBA of Font Diner, Inc.)
