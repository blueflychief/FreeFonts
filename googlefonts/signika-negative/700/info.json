  "description": "Signika is a sans-serif with a gentle character, developed for wayfinding, signage, and other media where clarity of information is required. It has a low contrast and tall x-height to improve readability of texts in small sizes as well as in large distances from the reader. Being a typical signage typeface it is inspired by typefaces such as Ronnia, Meta, and Tahoma. The typeface comes with a wide character set supporting Western European languages, Polish, and Czech. The figures are designed as tabular. This is the alternative Negative version, optimised to solve the effect of juxtaposed positive and negative text setting, where the text in negative tends to look thicker. Small caps and small-cap figures will be published soon.",
