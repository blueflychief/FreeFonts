  "description": "Imagine a post-apocalyptic world in the future. Imagine hiding in the underground: people, dirty air and despair. To transfer information, they still use fonts. But they have become simple, with a utilitarian and strong spirit. Stalinist is typeface for a post-apocalyptic time. Stalinist is a font made in Moscow at the end of the 21st century. That\u0027s the way it is. Stalinist One was designed collaboratively between Alexey Maslov and Jovanny Lemonad.",
