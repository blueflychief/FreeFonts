  "description": "Tangerine is a calligraphy font inspired by many italic chancery hands from the 16-17th century. Its tall ascender, the most distinct characteristic of this type, takes a wide line space between lines and gives it a graceful texture. It is generally advisable to use Tangerine for a title or short text at large size because of the short height of lowercase letters. Tangerine is produced by Japanese type designer Toshi Omagari and was named after a woman who encouraged him to begin this work.",
