  "description": "Text Me One is a monolinear font that plays with the shapes of open counters and un-connecting lines. A relatively large x-height and prominent in-strokes and out-strokes aid legibility. Its flavour is playful, with a hint of pop, and is ideal for large format lettering or continuous body text. To contribute to the project contact Julia Petretta.",
