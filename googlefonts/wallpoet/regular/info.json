  "description": "Wallpoet is inspired by the often political, short, sometimes provocative, sometimes funny or both, messages found on city walls, sprayed by some anonymous agent. Words, images or both! The idea behind the font is making a font with a bit of punch, but still easy to use for template graffiti. Print, cut \u0026 spray - being the key concept. That\u0027s why it has no curves and off course is a stencil font. With the font, Lars wants to pay respect to the urban guerilla scene, which has inspired him so often with it\u0027s total disrespect for the traditional and ingenious ability to break out of the traditional box.",
