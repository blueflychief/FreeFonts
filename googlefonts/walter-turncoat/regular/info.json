  "description": "Contrary to popular lore, Walter Turncoat was NOT a traitor executed during the Revolutionary War. Actually, Walter spent his days carefully executing new typefaces doing his part to help establish a free press! Ever the patriot, Squid honors old Walter with this spiffy font sure to bring out the Yankee Doodle in you. * All characters described above are fictitious with the possible exception of Squid, whose existence remains an ongoing debate. Nevertheless you should check out his other fonts.",
