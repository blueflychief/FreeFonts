  "description": "Wendy is loosely inspired by the STABILO logotype, a brand that works as a conceptual and aesthetic reference. It evokes in me design values, form and style. The challenge was take a logotype consisting of seven letters as a starting point to develop an alphabet. I liked the idea of the original logo for the beauty of its forms: original and risky. I liked to continue the work of someone whose development was arrested at another time, to animate these characters, giving them new life through the design of a typeface that finds the balance between the old and new forms. The font was developed by Alejandro Inler in conjunction with Julieta Ulanovsky.",
