  "description": "Wire One is a condensed monoline sans brought to you by Alexei Vanyashin and Gayaneh Bagdasaryan from Cyreal Type Foundry. Its modular-based characters are flavored with a sense of art nouveau. Nearly hairline thickness suggests usage for body text above 12px. While at display sizes it reveals its tiny dot terminals to create a sharp mood in headlines. It is recommended to adjust letter-spacing for sizes below 30px to 0.033em and up. For 12 px we recommend the value of 0.085em. Updated: January 2016 to version 1.012 with a minor technical fix to the GPOS table to ensure it works in Firefox 44.",
