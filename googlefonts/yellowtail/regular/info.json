  "description": "Yellowtail is an old school flavored flat brush script typeface of medium weight. It\u0027s mix of connecting and non-connecting letterforms lend to its unique look and legibility. Yellowtail nods to classic 1930\u0027s typestyles like Gillies Gothic \u0026 Kaufmann, yet has the loose visual cadence of sign painter scripts.",
